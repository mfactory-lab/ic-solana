> #### Interact with [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com) from the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).

## Overview

The **SOLANA RPC** is an Internet Computer (ICP) canister designed to facilitate robust communication
between the [Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain and the [Internet Computer (ICP)](https://internetcomputer.org/)
using an on-chain API.

This canister sends API requests to [JSON-RPC](https://solana.com/docs/rpc)
services via [HTTPS outcalls](https://internetcomputer.org/https-outcalls).
It enables functionalities similar to traditional Solana decentralized applications (dApps),
including querying Solana smart contract states and submitting raw transactions.

The canister runs on the 34-node
[`fiduciary subnet`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/subnets/subnet-types#fiduciary-subnets)
with the following principal:
[`bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai`](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai).

Refer to the [Reproducible Builds](#reproducible-builds) section for information on how to verify the hash of the deployed WebAssembly module.

## Features

- üîó **Seamless Blockchain Interaction:** Communicate effortlessly between Solana and ICP blockchains.
- üìù **Comprehensive Logging:** Enhanced logging capabilities for better monitoring and debugging.
- üß™ **Robust Testing Suite:** Extensive integration and unit tests to ensure reliability and stability.
- üèóÔ∏è **Reproducible Builds:** Ensures the integrity and security of the deployed WebAssembly module.
- üîí **Secure HTTPS Outcalls:** Guarantees data confidentiality and integrity during cross-chain communications.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [DFINITY SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/local-quickstart.html)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [PocketIC](https://github.com/dfinity/pocketic) (for testing)

Additionally, ensure that the `POCKET_IC_BIN` environment variable is set to the path of the `pocket-ic` binary.

## Quick start

Add the following configuration to your `dfx.json` file.
Replace the `ic` principal with the appropriate canister principal from the deployed canisters.

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "solana_rpc": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "https://github.com/mfactory-lab/ic-solana/releases/latest/download/ic-solana-rpc.did",
      "wasm": "https://github.com/mfactory-lab/ic-solana/releases/latest/download/ic-solana-rpc.wasm.gz",
      "remote": {
        "id": {
          "ic": "bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai",
          "playground": "bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Ensure you use the correct principal ID corresponding to your environment (e.g., `ic`,`playground`).
Refer to the [Deployment](#deployment-on-the-internet-computer) section for more details.

## Running the Project Locally

To test the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Replica:**

   ```shell
   dfx start --clean --background
   ```

   This command starts the local Internet Computer replica in the background.

2. **Build and Deploy Canisters:**

   ```shell
   dfx deploy solana_rpc --argument '(record {})'
   ```

   This command builds and deploys your canisters to the local replica and generates the Candid interface.

3. **Access the Application:**

   Once the build and deployment are complete, your application will be accessible at:

   ```
   http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}
   ```

   Replace `{asset_canister_id}` with the actual canister ID generated during deployment.

### Testing

We use [PocketIC](https://github.com/dfinity/pocketic) for integration testing. Please make sure to have it installed and the
`POCKET_IC_BIN` environment variable set to the path of the `pocket-ic` binary.

You can run the tests with the following commands:

**Running Tests:**

- **Run All Tests:**

  ```shell
  make test
  ```

- **Run a Specific Test:**

  ```shell
  make test TEST="specified_test_here"
  ```

## Deployment on the Internet Computer

The canister is deployed to `bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai`.

You can check the Candid UI at [
`https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai`](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai).

## Reproducible builds

The SOLANA RPC canister supports [reproducible builds](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/test/reproducible-builds):

1. Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is installed on your machine.
2. Run `./scripts/docker-build --rpc` in your terminal.
3. Run `sha256sum ic-solana-rpc.wasm.gz` on the generated file to view the SHA-256 hash.

Compare the generated SHA-256 hash with the hash provided in the repository to verify the build's integrity.
