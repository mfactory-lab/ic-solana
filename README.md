> #### Interact with [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com) from the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).

## Overview

**SOLANA RPC** is an Internet Computer canister smart contract for communicating
with [Solana](https://solana.com/) using an on-chain API.

This canister facilitates API requests to [JSON-RPC](https://solana.com/docs/rpc) services
using [HTTPS outcalls](https://internetcomputer.org/https-outcalls). This enables
functionality similar to traditional Solana dapps, including querying Solana smart contract states and submitting
raw transactions.

## Documentation

You can find extensive documentation for the SOLANA RPC canister in
the ...

## Canister

The SOLANA RPC canister runs on the 28-node fiduciary subnet with the following
principal: [`bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai`](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai).

Refer to the [Reproducible Builds](#reproducible-builds) section for information on how to verify the hash of the
deployed WebAssembly module.

## Quick Start

Add the following to your `dfx.json` config file (replace the `ic` principal with any option from the list of the
available canisters above):

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "solana_rpc": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "https://github.com/mfactory-lab/ic-solana/releases/latest/download/solana_rpc.did",
      "wasm": "https://github.com/mfactory-lab/ic-solana/releases/latest/download/solana_rpc.wasm.gz",
      "remote": {
        "id": {
          "ic": "bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai",
          "playground": "bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --clean --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

Once the job is completed, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

### Testing

We use [PocketIC](https://github.com/dfinity/pocketic) for integration testing. Please make sure to have it installed
and the `POCKET_IC_BIN` environment variable set to the path of the `pocket-ic` binary.

You can run the tests with the following command:

```sh
./scripts/test.sh
```

## Deployment on the Internet Computer

The canister is deployed to `bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai`.

You can check the Canid UI
at [`https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai`](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai).

### Interact with Blast Playground

You can interact with the canister using
the [Blast Playground](#).

## To Do

- [ ] Versioned transactions.
- [ ] Threshold EdDSA.

## Reproducible Builds

The SOLANA RPC canister
supports [reproducible builds](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/test/reproducible-builds):

1. Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is installed on your machine.
2. Run `scripts/docker-build` in your terminal.
4. Run `sha256sum solana_rpc.wasm.gz` on the generated file to view the SHA-256 hash.

In order to verify the latest SOLANA RPC Wasm file, please make sure to download the corresponding version of the source
code from the latest GitHub release.
